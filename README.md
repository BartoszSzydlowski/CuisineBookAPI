If you receive errors about missing packages, go to `Tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings` and in `General`, check both options under `Package Restore Section`. Then go to `Package Sources` and uncheck or remove `Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages`, then add new package source with any name, for example `nuget.org` and source with url `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`
